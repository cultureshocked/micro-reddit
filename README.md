# micro-reddit

This project was made to develop familiarity with RoR's ActiveRecord, and practice creating MVP Rails apps.

It was built with Ruby 3.2.1 and Rails 7.0.4.3

There are no other dependencies aside from `turbo-rails` and the rest of the Hotwire suite. Use the `Gemfile` and `bundle install` if required.
